## Object Orientated Design
* Common Design Patterns
* Inheritence
* Aggregation
* class, object (and the difference between the two)
* instantiation
* method (as opposed to, say, a C function)
* virtual method, pure virtual method
* class/static method
* static/class initializer
* constructor
* destructor/finalizer
* superclass or base class
* subclass or derived class
* encapsulation
* multiple inheritance (and give an example)
* delegation/forwarding
* composition/aggregation
* abstract class
* interface/protocol (and different from abstract class)
* method overriding
* method overloading (and difference from overriding)
* polymorphism (without resorting to examples)
* is-a versus has-a relationships (with examples)
* method signatures (what's included in one)
* method visibility (e.g. public/private/other)
